Collaborative constraint reasoning for Megatron-LM training:
Objective: Autonomously propose valid constraints from Megatron training workflow and build reasoning chains.

Constraint generation goals:
- Identify potential risk points in distributed training
- Based on official documentation, academic papers, and best practices
- Ensure practicality, innovation, and implementability
- Cover key checkpoints and exception handling

Key change: Use NEXT_ACTION: WRITE_CONSTRAINT to write directly to JSON file after validation.

Routing flow:
1. megatron_expert validates constraint completeness
2. Output NEXT_ACTION: WRITE_CONSTRAINT
3. coordinate_agent routes to write_agent
4. write_agent writes to predefined_constraints.json
5. write_agent reports completion

Output:
1) Constraints written to predefined_constraints.json
2) Complete reasoning chain with references
3) Next candidate constraint suggestions
